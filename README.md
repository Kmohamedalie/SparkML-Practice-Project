## **[Practice Case](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-apache-spark/supplement/VrMkz/practice-project-overview)**
Welcome to this [practice project](https://github.com/Kmohamedalie/sparkML-projects/blob/master/Practice_Project.ipynb), where you will create an end-to-end solution using machine learning pipelines for regression. Your objective is to clean the dataset, create a model that predicts the SoundLevel based on the other columns, evaluate its performance, and persist the model for future use.

## **[Final Case](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-apache-spark/supplement/DCKKu/final-project-overview)**
Welcome to the final project of this course! In this project, you will work with the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. The goal is to clean the dataset, create a Machine Learning pipeline, evaluate the model's performance, and persist it for future use.
